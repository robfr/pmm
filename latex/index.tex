Performance Model Manager

P\-M\-M is a tool that has been developed to address issues surrounding the construction, maintenance and use of Functional Performance Models in a variety of parallel computing environments. It consists of three main features\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Firstly it implements the Geometric Bisection Building Procedure for multi-\/parameter F\-P\-Ms, optimizing the construction of a problemâ€™s performance model.
\item Secondly, it permits a large number of problems to have their construction managed by implementing a flexible benchmarking scheduler, suitable for use where a queuing system does not exist.
\item Finally it provides access to the models in a variety of ways, allowing feedback from actual executions and providing tools to use the models in scheduling decisions.
\end{DoxyItemize}

This documentation describes the internal code that makes up P\-M\-M. The user guide can be found under docs/manual.\-pdf.
