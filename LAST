This file contains notes on the last thing that a developer was working on. It
serves as a reminder as to where an individual left off so that it is easier
to restart work after a pause.

rhiggins:

- problem with size of history array, it is -1 than the size, so the size
should be increased (i.e. if a user expects 60 history recordings then we
need to accoate 60+1 array elements to store this)

done ... writing history periodically is done, need to start reading history
at startup if it exists and also to perhaps write history using a thread and to
functionalise the history reading/writing.

	- messing around with load writing, new_load functino maybe not needed
	- human readable time is printed as comment in load history, remove or add as an attribute
    - seperate load function out of pmm_main.c
    - read period from configuration file
    
    
    
    
done ... fix make file to link with libxml

done ... fix make dist

* does log file work at all?
* configure script takes too long, checks things that are not needed
* error when conf file does not exist is not clear

everything else
