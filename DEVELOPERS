To bootstrap the PMM project the following tool versions are required:

aclocal >=?
autoconf >=2.60
automake >=1.11
libtool >=2.2.6
?compiler? >= ? probably gcc, probably 4.x

Run ./bootstrap from the base directory to prepare the project for configuration
and building.

Consider ./configuring with arguments:

    --enable-maintainer-mode
    --enable-debug

To build a distribution of this software you will need latex tools to create
the manual and doxygen to create the api documentation.
